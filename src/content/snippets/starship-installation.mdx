> Starship is a fast, minimal, and highly customizable cross-shell prompt.

## Prerequisities

1. **Terminal** of your choice
2. [**Nerd Font**](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) - Any font with the Nerd Font patch to display icons in the terminal
3. **Git Bash** - I am using git bash primarily, you can use any other.

## Installation
Install Starship using any package manager available on your machine. Detailed installation guides for various platforms are available on the [**official website**](https://starship.rs/).
